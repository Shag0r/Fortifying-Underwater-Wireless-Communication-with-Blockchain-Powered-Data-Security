# Introduction :
The Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly expanded, connecting various objects and systems worldwide. In underwater environments, known as the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs), IoT systems face challenges like data handling, security, and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this research explores integrating blockchain and IPFS technology. These technologies aim to enhance data security, scalability, and energy efficiency in IoUT systems. By transmitting data securely and efficiently, IoUTs can support applications such as tracking aquatic life and monitoring underwater conditions. Despite the potential of IoTs in underwater environments, limited research exists on their application in smart ocean solutions. Issues like data security and privacy persist due to the sheer volume of data and the complexity of managing it. Blockchain technology offers promise in addressing these challenges by providing secure data management and transfer capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing blockchain and IPFS to strengthen IoUT systems, ensuring safe and efficient underwater communication and data transmission. Through experimentation and case studies, the effectiveness of this approach is evaluated, laying the groundwork for safer and more efficient underwater IoT systems.

# Performance Overhead:
 Our model demonstrates strong resistance against at-
tacks, protecting data security in underwater communication
networks from a range of risks and vulnerabilities. With the in-
tegration of advanced security features like dynamic key man-
agement, role customization, double key security, and multi-
storage capabilities, our model provides robust protection
against malicious actions and unauthorized access attempts.
The absence of third-party authentication reduces dependency
on outside parties, which lowers risks related to third-party
dependencies and improves system security in general. This
independent approach ensures that even under challenging or
detached conditions, data transmission and communication in
underwater settings stay secure and trustworthy.
